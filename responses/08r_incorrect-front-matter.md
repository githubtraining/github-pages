## Checking your front matter

It looks like there may be some errors in your front matter. Take a look at your front matter and make sure the following is true:

- [{{ dashes }}] You used dashes on the first and final line
- [{{ title }}] You added a page title surrounded in quotes
- [{{ date }}] You added a date using the correct format

The YAML front matter should be at the top of your blog post file and should look something like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Your blog post title"
date:  YYYY-MM-DD
---
```
