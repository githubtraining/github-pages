:warning: Do not merge yet! :warning:

This pull request looks great so far. :sparkles: You've just edited the `_config.yml` file! We have some more work to do to create your blog site. You can continue to make commits on your `{{ branch }}` branch and the pull request will update automatically.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add some content to your blog

1. On the "Code" tab, select your `{{ branch }}` branch
1. Click **Create new file**
1. Name the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, but replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date, and `title` with the title you'd like to use for your first blog post

   - If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "[Page build failed: Invalid post date](https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-invalid-post-date/)".

1. Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later
1. Commit your changes to your branch
