## Step 5: Customize Site Details

Great work! You can see your selected theme in action [here](https://{{ user.username }}.github.io/{{ repo }}). If you don't see your changes right away, refresh the page.

### Getting your page blog ready

GitHub added the theme you selected to your `_config.yml` file. Jekyll uses the `_config.yml` file to store  settings for your site, like your theme, as well as reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle.

You can check out the `_config.yml` file on the main page of your repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Modify the config file

Let's change the `_config.yml` so it's a perfect fit for your new blog. First, we need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named `minima`.

1. On the main page of your repository , browse to the `_config.yml` file.
1. In the upper right corner, click :pencil2: to open the file editor.
1. Change `theme:` to **minima** and modify the other configuration variables such as `title:`, `author:`, and `description:` to customize your site.
1. Click **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
