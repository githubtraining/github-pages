## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

Welcome to GitHub Pages and Jekyll :tada:!

In this course, you'll learn how to build and host a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site. With GitHub Pages, you can host content like [documentation](https://flight-manual.atom.io/), [resumes](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template), or any other type of content youâ€™d like.

In this course, you'll create a blog hosted on GitHub Pages and learn how to:

- Enable GitHub Pages
- Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator
- Customize Jekyll sites with a theme and content

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a regresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

### :keyboard: Activity: Turn on GitHub Pages

The first step to publishing your blog site to the web is to enable GitHub Pages on this repository <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)</sup>. When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the master branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

1. Under your repository name, click [**Settings**](https://github.com/{{ owner }}/{{ repo }}/settings)
1. In the "GitHub Pages" section, use the Select source drop-down menu to select the `master branch` as your GitHub Pages publishing source.
1. Click **Save**

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, we'll create some content.

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.
