## Step 7: Add blog post metadata

Now that you've created your Jekyll blog post file, we can add syntax to it. The syntax Jekyll files use is called YAML front matter. It goes at the top of your file and looks something like this:

```yml
---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
date: 2019-01-20
---
```

This example adds a title and date to your blog post. There are other useful things you could add here in the future like layouts, categories, or any other logic that is useful to you. For more information about configuring front matter, see the [Jekyll front matter documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
